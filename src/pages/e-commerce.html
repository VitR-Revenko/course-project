          An endless stream of contracts, tax issues, labor relations, corporate papers - legal work distracts you from
          doing business. But there is not much work to do to hire an in-house lawyer.
          <br />
          In addition, over time, the work will become the same type and uninteresting for a full-time lawyer. And we
          know very well how difficult it is to find a good candidate with experience in the field of information
          technology in Ukraine.
